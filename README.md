# Budget Tracker (PWA)

Though useful, calculators lack a visual medium for users to keep track of their expenses over a period of time. Since users cannot specify what money is coming in from or where it's going, they are left with a number and must remember the transactions that occurred leading up to it.
Next time, put the calculator down and give the Budget Tracker application a try! This service allows users to input a name or short description of a purchase and add or subtract the amount spent. The website provides users with a graph that contains nodes that allow the user to see what was purchased or added to an account over a certain period of time.
No internet access? That's alright! The user can download this application and use it on the go. Once they have returned to an area with internet connection, the transactions will automatically update and will be reflected in the applications graph and account total.
The Budge Tracker provides a modern solution to calculating your expenses on the go.
